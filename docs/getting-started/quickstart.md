# 🕹️ Quickstart

This guide will help you quickly understand and use the ArtFlip platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An EVM-compatible wallet (such as MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Sufficient tokens to pay for gas fees
- Basic understanding of NFTs and blockchain concepts

## Supported Chains

ArtFlip currently supports the following blockchain networks:

- **BSC (Binance Smart Chain)**
- **Base**
- **Polygon**

Support for more EVM-compatible chains is under development.

## Basic Operations

### Buying NFTs

1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse available NFT projects
3. Select the NFT you want to purchase
4. Confirm the transaction and pay

The price will be automatically calculated based on the Bonding Curve algorithm.

### Selling NFTs

1. View your held NFTs in your wallet
2. Select the NFT you want to sell
3. Confirm the selling price (automatically calculated by the algorithm)
4. Complete the transaction

Sold NFTs will automatically enter the trading pool for other users to purchase.

### Creating NFT Projects

1. Prepare your NFT metadata and resources
2. Configure project parameters (initial price, price cap, etc.)
3. Deploy smart contracts
4. Start minting

**Note**: Project creators have no reserved rights and must participate in purchases on equal terms with regular users.

## Pricing Mechanism

ArtFlip uses the Bonding Curve algorithm for intelligent pricing:

- **Initial Price**: Starts from a preset baseline
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Price gradually increases as minting volume increases
- **Price Cap**: Stops rising after reaching the preset cap
- **Instant Trading**: Both buy and sell prices are calculated in real-time by the algorithm

## Royalty Mechanism

- Creators can receive royalties from each transaction
- Royalty percentage is set when the project is created
- The royalty mechanism incentivizes creators to continuously add value to the project
